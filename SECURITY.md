# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

- `1.x` — actively maintained

## Reporting

If you discover a security issue, please open a private report or contact the maintainer.
For local-only prototypes, a GitHub issue is acceptable.

## Dependency Hygiene

- `npm audit` is expected to be clean before release.
- CI runs format, lint, tests, build, and e2e.
